A mix of Sprites for Pokemon Essentials, edited / coloured / made by CoreBear!

Currently working on a few Bulbasaur sprites for my game, then I'll be moving onto regional forms and stuff.
Some mega evolutions are WIP, I'll share once I'm kinda happy with them

Rose-bulb Bulbasaur's Icon is literally just a recolour rn, I'll fix it eventually but at the moment it's not a big enough deal to rush
Rose-bulb Bulbasaur's back sprite could be touched up but I'm happy with it for now :)

No PBS yet, only thing I've set up is my Rose-bulb boi in pokemonforms.txt.
I may or may not have some branching evolutions for the pokemon in the future, so evolution methods and the like aren't set in stone; however, for Neutrun, it's obtain method is intended to be through breeding Plusle and Minun together (credits to TechSkylander1518 + their egg-modification guide, it helped me significantly: https://reliccastle.com/resources/662/)

I may use other people's / official older gen sprites as bases for my own. I give credit where it's due; the backsprites originate from the EBDX folder of The Gen 8 Project, and the fronts were frankenstein'ed together and redrawn from official sprites obtained from https://pokemondb.net/sprites

You don't *need* to credit me for any of these sprites, but if you want to then I'll gladly accept. I hope you like them, if you have any requests let me know and I'll consider working on it :D
