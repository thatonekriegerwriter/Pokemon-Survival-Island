# Difficulty Modes
This script is for Pokémon Essentials. It allows a easy way to make difficulty modes like the ones on Key System in B2W2.

A difficulty mode may change:
- Wild Pokémon levels
- Trainer's Pokémon levels
- Trainer's skill level
- Trainer's money given
- Trainer definition (define a different trainer entry in trainers.txt)
- Exp received

## Compatibility
Doesn't work on Essentials versions older than v19. To see other Essentials versions, look at [all branches](../../branches/all).

## Installation
Follow the [Script](/Script.rb) instructions.
